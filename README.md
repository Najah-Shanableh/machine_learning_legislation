Machine Learning Legislation
============================
There is a need among the advocacy and research communities to dissect bills quickly. These long and often mind-numbing documents are had to keep track of as changes come and go. This project will create tools to help in the analysis and access of government bills.

One primary use case is spending bills. This project will help create a database of spending; going through the text of spending bills to identify and organizing the what, where, how much, and who.

We will use two APIs provided by the Sunlight Foundation for this project to get access to machine readable versions of the bills.
